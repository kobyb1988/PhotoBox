Windows version
Be sure to copy all EDSDK modules into the application sub folder.

Note1:
	Be absolutely sure when you overwrite the old version of the library whenever a new version of EDSDK
	becomes available. We recommend that you copy files while comparing file versions of the library.
Note2:
	Do not copy the EDSDK module to the Windows System folder or Windows folder.
Note3:
	In order to connect to an EOS digital camera, the correct device driver software must be installed and a
	connection between the camera and the host PC must be established. (Driver software is not needed when using a
	camera model that performs PTP communications.) For details, see the installation method for drivers in the
	software installation guide included with your EOS digital camera.
